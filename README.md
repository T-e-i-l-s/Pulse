# Pulse

Pulse is an **open-source**, modern Android application that helps monitor server status and notifies users when something goes wrong. Users can create requests by specifying the type (**GET, POST, etc.**) and URL. The system periodically checks the server status and sends a notification if the response code is **400 or higher**.

Built with **Jetpack Compose**, the application provides a modern **UI** with high responsiveness. The minimum supported Android version is **8 (API 26)**.

## ‚è¨ Installation

There are several ways to get the **release .apk** of the Pulse application:

#### 1. Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/T-e-i-l-s/Pulse/releases)

The fastest way is to download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/T-e-i-l-s/Pulse/releases), where you can find all available versions of Pulse.

#### 2. Download from the latest CI Job

This method is more flexible than the first one because it allows you to get both **release** and **debug** versions. You can also download builds from the **develop** branch or other branches to test specific features.

‚ö†Ô∏è **We recommend using the latest version from the `main` branch, as it is the most stable.**

#### 3. Build the project yourself

This is the most complex method but gives you full control over the build process.

To build Pulse from source:

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the project in **Android Studio**

3. Run the build process
